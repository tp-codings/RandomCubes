# Random Cubes
A program that generates a line of blocks in threedimensional space block after block with random orientations. 
This Project is based on my little (for sure improvable) "[Engine](https://github.com/tp-codings/Little_OpenGL_Simulation_Engine/edit/master/README.md)" for OpenGL simulations. 

## Features
- interactive movement of the camera in threedimensional space
- different sky boxes
- directional light shading

# Getting Started

# Open Issues
Actually this was inspired by this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Uw0P08Mj4) by Coder Space. So why I decided to change orientation of the cubes randomly? I have no idea.
